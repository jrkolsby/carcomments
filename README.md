# CarComments

`CarComments` is a small website that allows users to comment on license plate numbers. This was a pretty simple project, though it did include certain obstacles I had never encountered before. For instance, I needed a way of preventing users from posting too frequently, for which I employed cookies that expire once the posting delay ends. As well, while iterating through the `comments` table, I needed a method of grouping comments with the same license plate.

## Why

I got the idea for this project from the website [Things I Want Made](http://thingsiwantmade.com/), where the idea was posted. I was under the impression that if I made CarComments and posted it to TIWM, people would use it. If you have visited `CarComments`, however, you'll immediately notice the large imbalance between actual human-made posts and spam posts. Perhaps I should include a captcha to block these posts and advertise the website to humans a bit more.
